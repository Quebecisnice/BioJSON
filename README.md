# BioJSON

**BioJSON** is a collection of rough but functional hacks to pull biological flatfiles kicking and screaming into the world of simple data exchange standards. 

It uses pyparsing as the recursive descent parsing engine.  Currently only the genbank file parser is present, parsers for BLAST, HMMER, and other formats will 
be added as needed
